# E-Mail Spam Classification via Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building an **E-Mail Spam Classification** system using **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. The goal of this project is to classify emails into two categories: **Spam** (unsolicited or junk emails) and **Ham** (legitimate emails). The system leverages various machine learning algorithms and NLP techniques to analyze and classify emails based on their content.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model (you can add a link to the dataset or instructions on how to obtain it).
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks used for model experimentation, data processing, and evaluation.
- **`models/`**: Scripts for training machine learning models and evaluating their performance.
- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts for pre-processing data, feature extraction, model training, and classification.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Contains the required Python libraries for running the project.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Key Features

1. **Email Preprocessing**: Text cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Usage of **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and other NLP techniques for extracting features from email content.
3. **Machine Learning Models**: Training multiple machine learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, etc.) to classify emails.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Spam Classification**: Classifying an email as either *Spam* or *Ham* based on trained models.

## Models and Techniques Used

- **Naive Bayes**: A simple probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful classifier used for high-dimensional data like text.
- **Logistic Regression**: A commonly used machine learning model for binary classification.
- **Deep Learning Models (LSTM, RNN)**: Advanced models for sequence prediction, applied for spam classification.

## Results and Performance

The model achieves an accuracy of approximately **95%** on the test dataset. Precision, recall, and F1-score metrics are also computed to evaluate the model's performance in detecting spam emails.

## Future Improvements

- **Advanced NLP Models**: Implementing state-of-the-art models like **BERT** for better text understanding and context.
- **Real-Time Spam Filtering**: Integrating the model into a real-time email client or service.
- **Additional Features**: Including more metadata (like sender information, subject) for improved classification.
