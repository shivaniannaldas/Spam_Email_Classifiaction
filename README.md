# Spam Email Classification using NLP and Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying emails as **Spam** (unsolicited emails) or **Ham** (legitimate emails) using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques. The project involves preprocessing the email content, extracting features, training various machine learning models, and evaluating their performance in identifying spam emails.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model (you can add a link to the dataset or instructions on how to obtain it).
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for experimenting with data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- **`models/`**: Python scripts for building and training machine learning models like Naive Bayes, SVM, etc.
- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts for preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and classification.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all the Python libraries required to run the project.
- **`README.md`**: This file, which explains the project and its structure.

## Key Features

- **`Spam Detector.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook for exploring the dataset, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **`spam.csv`**: The dataset containing labeled emails (Spam and Ham).
- **`spam.pkl`**: Serialized machine learning model that has been trained on the dataset.
- **`spamDetector.py`**: Python script that contains the logic for loading the trained model and making predictions on new email data.
- **`vec.pkl`**: Serialized vectorizer used to transform the text data (email content) into numerical features before feeding it to the model.

## Models and Techniques Used

- **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier that works well with text data.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful classifier for high-dimensional data.
- **Logistic Regression**: A binary classification model.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: A deep learning model for handling sequential data like email content.

## Results and Performance

The model achieves an accuracy of around **95%** on the test dataset, with good precision, recall, and F1-score values for spam detection. 
## Future Improvements

- **Advanced NLP Models**: Incorporating state-of-the-art models like **BERT** for better text classification performance.
- **Real-Time Spam Filtering**: Integrating the spam classification model into an email service or real-time email client.
- **Hybrid Models**: Combining machine learning and deep learning techniques for improved accuracy.
